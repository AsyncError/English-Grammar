# 定语和定语从句

## No.1 定语的组成

### 1.1 什么是定语？

只要听到「XXX的 + 名词」，「XXX的」就是修饰这个名词的定语成分。 

### 1.2 定语的成分

```
The innocent nightingale died.
```

1.形容词作定语

```
The nightingale brave and innocent died.
```

2.名词「短语」作定语

```

```

3.介词短语作定语

```

```

4.非谓语动词作定语

```
The singing nightingale lost its life.
```

5.从句作定语

```

## No.2 定语的位置

## 2.1 前小后大

当一个单词修饰名词时，通常放在名词前。

当多个单词修饰名词时，通常放在名词后。

### 2.1.1 练习

```
这是一个关于夜莺和玫瑰的故事。
This is a fiction about a nightingale and a rose.

那个懂爱的年轻人离开了王子的舞会。
The youngster grasping romance left the party of the prince.

//当过去分词修饰名词时，即使只有一个单词也通常放在名词之后

我有重要的事情要告诉你
I hava something important to tell you.
//当形容词修饰不定代词的时候，即使只有一个单词，也通常放在其后
```

## No.3定语从句

### 3.1 定语从句的构成

```
名词+引导词+句子（从句）
```

### 3.2 定语从句的引导词

定语从句的引导词是按照引导词的种类进行分类

```
人：who whom whose (that)
物：that which whose
时间：that which when
地点：that which where
原因：that which why
```

#### 3.2.1 谁决定引导词的用法

定语从句中 that 一般等于 which

that是关系代词，从句不缺成分时不用 that

先行词和引导词在从句中能够充当的成分共同决定了引导词的用法。

#### 3.2.2 示例

```
I will never forget the day when I met you.
I will never forget the day that we spent.

You had better have some reason why you are late.
You had better have some reason that sounds perfect.
```

### 3.3 引导词的分类新标准

引导词可以按照引导词本身的词性分类

1.代词（在从句中一定要充当主语或者宾语的成分）

```
who whom that which
```

2.副词（在从句中不能充当任何主干成分）

```c#
where when why
```

3.在从句中修饰离他最近的形容词

```
whose
//人或物的定语从句不缺成分时
```

##  No.4 定语从句的练习

```

Buildings whose roofs are round look beautiful.

成功属于有梦想的人，这已经被无数个事实所证明了。
It has been validated by numerous facts that glories belong to those with dreams.

Wearing my own shoes proves not only convenient but also ensures a point that the feelings of others can be ignored. 

问题的关键是谁应该为道德的沦丧负责。
The point of issue seems who should be responsible for the decline of ethics.

外表看起来很邋遢的他其实内心很高尚。
He whose appearance looks indecent proves noble in his mind.

那些全力以赴去实现梦想的人，即使没有成功也不会感到遗憾，这是很重要。
It seems indispensable that those who spare no efforts to realize their dreams never feel pitiful, although glories fail to be achieved.

上课不集中精力，而又希望通过考试的学生，往往发现结果差强人意。
Students who fail to concentrate in class but wish to pass examinations smoothly tend to find that consequence proves less impressive. 
```

## No.5 定语从句的特殊用法

1.that 引导定语从句时，如果在从句中充当的时宾语，that可以被省略

``` 
I enjoy the book (that) my mom bought for me.
//在分析长难句的时候，如果见到有两个名词或者代词直接放在一起，中间没有被连词或标点符号隔开，通常都是省略了that的定语从句

The potential evolution of today's technology, and its social consequences, is dazzlingly complicated, and it's perhaps best left to science-fiction writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities (that) we can envisage.
现代技术的潜在发展及其社会影响是很复杂的，留给科幻小说家和未来学家去探索更多我们能想象到的可能性，这可能是最好的（选择）。
```

2.区别限制和非限制性定语从句

限制和非限制性定语从句在分析长难句时，非限制性定语从句就相当于插入语可以完全不看。

```
I love her, who is beautiful. //我爱她，她很美。
I love her who is beautiful. //我爱美丽的她。

Edison, whose invebtions have over 2,000, is a famous scientist.
```

3.先行词和引导词之间有介词的情况

人不用 who 只能用 whom，物不用that只能用 which。

```
He is the man who/whom we should learn from.
He is the man from whom we should learn.

I will never forget the day when I met you.
I will never forget the day on which I met you.
```

4.区别 the same ... as; the same ... that 引导的定语从句

```
She is the same girl as I love. //她像我爱的那个女孩
She is the same girl that I love. //她是我爱的那个女孩
```

5.as 和 which 引导的非限制性定语从句

which 引导的非限制性定语从句可以修饰前面整个句子，as 也可以。

但是 which 只能放在主句的后面，而 as 可前可后。

```
他喜欢和年轻女人说话，这驱使我发疯了。
He enjoys talking with young ladies, which/as drives me mad.
As drives me mad, He enjoys talking with young ladies.
//which指的是前面的整句话
```

6.定语从句中定语从句 which 和 that 的区别。

## No.6 区分定语从句和同位语从句

```
I have a dream that sounds funny. //定语从句
I have a dream that I will become a rich lady. //同位语从句
```

1.看从句本身的意思，定语从句是对名词的修饰，同位语从句是对名词的解释

2.看引导词 that 是否在句中充当成分，在定语从句中 that 做代词，在同位语从句中做引导词不充当成分

3.定语从句的先行词可以是所有的名词，同位语的先行词只能是抽象名词。

4.同位语从句的引导词通常是 that，而定语从句有八个引导词

## No.7 定语从句的至难点

### 7.1 寻找先行词

1.定语从句的先行词就是他前面最近的那个名词。

```
The words used by the speaker may stir up unfavorable reactions in the listener which interfere with his comprehension, hence, the transmission-reception system breaks down.
说话者使用的语言可能会激起听者不好的反应，阻碍听者的理解，因此，传输-接受系统就中断了。
```

2.定语从句的先行词是他前面的几个并列的名词

```
For workers it can mean an end to the security, benefits and sense of importance that came from being a loyal employee.
对于工人来说，作为一名忠诚的员工，这可能意味着安全、福利和责任感的结束，
```

3.定语从句的先行词是他前面的一个从句

```
The Greek assumed that the structure of language had some connection with the process of thought, which took root in Europe long before people realized how diverse language could be.
希腊人认为语言的结构和思维过程有关系，这已经在欧洲扎根了，在人们意识到语言有多样性之前很久。
```

4.定语从句的先行词是他前面的一个句子 

```
My husband enjoys talking with other young ladies, which really gets me go mad.
我的丈夫喜欢和其他年轻的女士交流，这真的快让我发疯了。
```

5.定语从句的引导词和先行词被隔开了

```

作为一个语言学家，他认为各种各样的人类语言，包括非标准的那些比如黑人英语，都可以强力地表达，没有语言或者方言在这个世界上是不能传达复杂的思想的。
```

Doors will be sticked by couplets topic whose are involved in health, wealth and good luck.
```

### 8.2 长难句

找定语的关键是找名词，只要名词之后有结构，且不是动词，就暂定其为修饰该名词的定语成分（也可能是状语）。

定语从名词后开始，到主句的谓语动词结束。

如果名词在主句的谓语动词之后，定语就从名词后结束，通常到句末结束。



一个大定语中通常有很多小定语。

```
Creating a "European identity" that respects the different cultures and traditions which go to make up the connecting fabric of the Old Continent is no easy task and demands a strategic choice.

Some of these cause are completely reasonable results of social needs, others are reasonable consequences [of particular advances] [in science] [being to some extent self-accelerating].
一些原因完全是社会需要的合理结果，另一些是，在某种程度上自我加速的科学上的特殊进步的合理的结果。
```

名词之后可能出现的结构

```
名词 + 定语
名词 + 动词

名词 + 状语（暂不考虑）
名词 + 同位语（与定语无区别）
名词 + 插入语（和其他区别较大）
```
