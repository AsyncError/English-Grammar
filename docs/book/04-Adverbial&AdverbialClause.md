### 3.1 引导词的分类标准

状语从句的引导词是按照引导词本身的意思进行分类

### 3.2 时间状语从句

```

the moment (一...就...)
as soon as (一...就...)
by the time

```

#### 3.2.1 状语从句的时态问题

在所有的状语从句中如果主句的动作和从句的动作都没有发生的话，主句用一般将来时，从句用一般现在时，即主将从现

```

When love comes, I will hold her hands.

当爱来临的时候，我没有牵住她的手
When love came, I failed to hold her hands.
```

#### 3.2.2 区别until和not...until

I will not leave you come.

直到我长大，我才懂得妈妈的伟大
I didn't realize the greatness of mothers until I grew up.
```

#### 3.2.3  when 引导的时间状语从句省略的情况

### 4.2 长难句

能够快速地识别句子当中的状语成分，并通顺 地翻译出来。

只要在句子中见到副词、比较、条件、结果、原因、让步、目的、方式、伴随(with)一定是状语。

如果见到名词+时间/地点，就需要区别是状语还是定语。

如果无法确定是状语还是定语，定语优先。只有翻译为定语时意思不通顺就翻译为状语

```
I love a girl in ZheJiang University.
我爱上了一个浙江大学的女生。
```
