## No.2 什么是状语

### 2.1 状语的含义

状语在句子中修饰实义动词、形容词、副词或整个句子的成分。

除了名词其他成分都能修饰

```

## No.3 状语从句

### 3.1 引导词的分类标准

状语从句的引导词是按照引导词本身的意思进行分类

### 3.2 时间状语从句

```
when
while (后跟进行时态)
as
before
after
since (自从，只有主句是现在完成时才可能使用 since)
-I have fallen in love with you since I met you.
the moment (一...就...)
as soon as (一...就...)
by the time
until (直到...才...)
not...until... (直到...才...)
```

#### 3.2.1 状语从句的时态问题

在所有的状语从句中如果主句的动作和从句的动作都没有发生的话，主句用一般将来时，从句用一般现在时，即主将从现

```
当爱来临的时候，我会牵住她的手
When love comes, I will hold her hands.

当爱来临的时候，我没有牵住她的手
When love came, I failed to hold her hands.
```

#### 3.2.2 区别until和not...until

看主句的动词是延续性动词还是瞬间动词，如果是延续性动词只用until，否则用后者

```
I will wait here until you come.
I will not leave you come.

直到我长大，我才懂得妈妈的伟大
I didn't realize the greatness of mothers until I grew up.
```

#### 3.2.3  when 引导的时间状语从句省略的情况

when引导的时间状语从句，如果主句的主语和从句的主语一直，并且从句中谓语动词是be动词，此时主语和be动词都可以省略。

```
When I was a kid, I enjoy singing songs.
->
When a kid, I enjoy singing songs.
```

### 3.3 地点状语从句

#### 3.3.1 常用引导词
